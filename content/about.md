I'm an italo:it:-brazilian:brazil: freelancer Software Engineer and Architect. I'm based in Germany, living here for the past 5 years. 

On my journey, I've helped companies of all sizes with building efficient and scalable systems, with focus on cloud native applications and microservices.

Graduated in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, one of the most recognized universities in South America, I've been working with complex systems since the beginning of my career. It all started in Brazil, as a Software Engineer for [Hewlett-Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/). In Germany, I was a consultant for Accenture with focus on Lightweight Architectures based on Microservices. Later on, I took a position as Blockchain Architect at IBM, where my most notable activity was the lead development role for [Thank My Farmer](https://www.thankmyfarmer.com), a consumer-based Progressive Web App in the consumer [goods industry](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/coffee/).

Besides being a techie, as a good south-american, you're always going to hear me talking about football while enjoying a [Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)) :mate:
